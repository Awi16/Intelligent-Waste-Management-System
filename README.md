# Intelligent-Waste-Management-System
Cloud Computing & IoT Project

## Overview
With urbanization on the rise and waste management becoming an escalating concern, our project introduces an innovative solutionâ€“ the Intelligent Waste Management System (IWMS). Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like IoT devices and Thingspeak, the IWMS aims to revolutionize garbage collection using datavisualization & data analysis. The goal is to minimize environmental impact, reduce costs, and optimize resource recovery.

## Tools
 1.Hardware:
 (a) HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
 (b) MQ-135 Gas Sensor
 (c) ESP32
 (d) Mini breadboard
 (e) Jumper Wires
 (f) Micro USB Cable
 
 2. Software:
 (a) ThingSpeak
 (b) Firebase
 (c) Arduino IDE

 ## Uses & Benefits
1. Detect fill levels in waste bins and send data to a central system.
2. Equipped with IoT devices for monitoring waste types and volumes.
3. Sends Email to the central System when the bin is full up to the mark or if it is stinky.
4. Reduces costs associated with waste collection and disposal.
5. Reduces fuel consumption and labor costs through route optimization.
